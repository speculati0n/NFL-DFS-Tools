# NFL-DFS-Tools

Packaged in this repository is an NFL Optimizer and GPP Simulator for DraftKings (with FanDuel on the way), along with other tools you might find useful in helping you win your Cash games, Head-to-heads and Tournaments. You'll find installation and usage instructions below. If at any time you have an issue and want help, or want to discuss strategies with other users, you can [join our discord here.](https://discord.gg/ThVAYfVuzU)

This tool was created in conjunction with [@bjungwirth](https://github.com/bjungwirth) who is knowledgeable in both DFS game theory as well advanced python data science and data strucures. You can check him out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blainejungwirth?lang=en) or read [his blog.](http://http://jungwirb.io/)

## Installation

If you're lazy and don't like reading, you can check this video which covers _most_ everything listed below. Note that this video concerns our NBA-DFS-Tools repo, so treat this README as gospel.
[![NBA-DFS-Tools Installation and Usage Guide](https://i.imgur.com/taXdZVQ.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r3_n9qrZ0Y "NBA-DFS-Tools Installation and Usage Guide")

### System requirements

-   To run the tools, you will need to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't already have it. These tools were bult on Python >=3.8.2, and may be incompatible with outdated versions of Python.
-   In addition to the base python installation, you will need the following packages:
    -   [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) - `pip install pulp`. This is the linear programming solver - the "optimizer" if you will.
    -   [timedelta](https://pypi.org/project/timedelta/) - `pip install timedelta`. This package makes it easy to interpret dates for late swaptimizing lineups.
    -   [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) - `pip install pytz`. Another helpful package for interpreting dates and late swaptimizing
    -   [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) - `pip install numpy`. This package makes data manipulation and handling matrices easier.
    -   [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) - `pip install pandas`. This package converts pythonic data structures (dicts, lists, etc) to more familiar tabular data structures.

If you'd like to install all dependencies in one step, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install these tools, you may either clone this repository or download the repository as a ZIP file (see image below) and extract it to the directory of your choosing.

![Download image](readme_images/download.png)

After you have cloned or downloaded the code base, you must import player contest data from DraftKings or FanDuel. Reference the screenshots below for your relative site. You will need to rename these files to `player_ids.csv`, and place into their relative directory (`dk_data/` or `fd_data/`). These directories should be folders located in the same directory as `src/` and `output/`, and will hold relevant data for each site. For DraftKings the file must include the columns `start_date`, `draftableid`, `displayname`, `position`, `firstname`, `lastname`, and `shortname`.

After you have the player data, you must import projection data. The projections CSV should provide `name`, `pos`, `team`, `salary`, `projections_proj`, `projections_projown`, and `fantasyyear_consistency` columns. Download the file and rename it to match the image below. These will go in either `dk_data/` or `fd_data/` depending on which data you downloaded.

## Usage

### Web Interface

Run `python app.py` to start a local server. The homepage lets you upload projections, player IDs, and optional contest structure or config files. After uploading, you can run the optimizer or simulator and view the resulting tables directly in your browser.

If you prefer Streamlit, run `streamlit run src/main.py` for a lightweight interface that offers similar upload, optimization, and simulation workflows.

### Command Line

To use the tools, you will need to open a windows console or powershell terminal in the same directory as this repository. To do this, go to the root directory and then navigate to `File > Open Windows Powershell` as seen below.

![Shell image](readme_images/shell.png)

To run the tools, the generic usage template is as follows:
`python .\main.py <site> <process> <num_lineups> <num_uniques>`

Where:
`<site>` is:

-   `dk` for DraftKings. Note for DraftKings, if you run into any KeyErrors on player names (e.g. Matthew Fitzpatrick vs Matt Fitzpatrick) you must also run `python .\name_change.py` before any crunching/simulating, as some player names differ between projections and DraftKings's player data
-   `fd` for FanDuel. Note for FanDuel, you must also run `python .\name_change.py` before any crunching, as some player names differ between projections and FanDuel's player data

`<process>` is:

-   `opto` for running optimal lineup crunches, with or without randomness
-   `sim` for running GPP simulations

    -   Usage #1 allows you to run arbitrary simulations for any field size and number of iterations, without regards to a real contest structure. The usage for this is: `python .\main.py <site> sim <field_size> <num_iterations>`, where `<field_size>` is the known entrant size, `<num_iterations>` is the number of times you wish to simulate the tournament.

    -   Usage #2 allows you to specify an actual DraftKings contest, which will dictate `<field_size>`. You will specify the number of iterations, but specifying the contest allows the simulation to take ROI into account, since the payout structure and entry fee is known. The usage for this is: `python .\main.py <site> sim cid <num_iterations> <match>`. To execute this usage, you will need a `contest_structure.csv` file in the structure of the image shown below. You can obtain this fairly quickly by opening up the contest details overlay and copy/pasting the prize payouts section into Excel or Google sheets, then using `Ctrl+H` to get rid of 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th', etc...

        ![Contest structure input](readme_images/contest_structure_input.png)

        -   Additionally, you may opt to upload lineups from a file rather than have them randomly generated/simulated. To specify this option, you will add `file` as a flag in your command like so: `python .\main.py <site> sim cid file 10000`. You must have an input file called `tournament_lineups.csv` in the base input directory. This allows you to upload specifically-tailored lineups that you feel are more representative of your contest than the ones generated. It also has the added benefit of being much faster than generating lineups. For example, you may take the output of the `opto` process, and rename the file to `tournament_lineups.csv`, and use those as your input for the `sim` process. The simulator will now automatically generate the difference between the number of lineups in the `tournament_lineups.csv` file and the `<field_size>` parameter from either the `contest_structure.csv` or the shell prompt.

        The `tournament_lineups.csv` file requires six columns, one for each player in a lineup. Players can either have their full name or full name and player id in parentheses.

        ![Example usage](readme_images/tournament_lineups.png)

-   `sd_opto` for running showdown crunches, with or without randomness

`<num_lineups>` is the number of lineups you want to generate when using the `opto` process.

`<num_uniques>` defines the number of players that must differ from one lineup to the next. These unique constraints are applied at the time of optimization, so if you ask for 10 lineups with 5 unique players, you will get 10 lineups with 5 unique players. In the past, this was enforced post-optimization, meaning it would prune lineups from the pool if they violated the unique constraints, resulting in fewer lineups than requested.

For example, to generate 1000 lineups for DraftKings, with 3 uniques and randomness, I would execute the following:
`python .\main.py dk opto 1000 3` with `"randomness": X` in `config.json` where `X` is a number between 0 and 100

The image below shows what the shell/terminal should look like when executing this. You may safely ignore the PuLP overwriting warning, as we must overwrite the linear programming objective with the updated random projections.

![Example usage](readme_images/usage.png)

### Stack Profiles

The optimizer can steer final lineups toward profile-driven stack exposures. Use the `--profile` and `--pool-factor` flags when running the CLI:

```
# consistency build (mirror the field, slight TE bump)
python -m src.cli dk opto --profile top10_consistency --pool-factor 5.0
# ceiling build (TE-heavy, double+bring-back spice)
python -m src.cli dk opto --profile top1_ceiling --pool-factor 6.0

```

## Config

In the base directory, you will find `sample.config.json`, which has a few template options for you to limit players from teams, and make groups of players you want a limit on. This is just meant to show you how you structure rules in this optimizer. When you're ready, copy this file and rename it to `config.json`. Note that you cannot have comments in this file and it must be properly formatted. If you're on windows, be sure you are renaming the entire file to `config.json` and not `config.json.json`. This can happen if you don't have file name extensions visible. To fix this, in your windows file explorer, go to the "View" tab up top, and tick the box that says "File name extensions".

If `config.json` is missing, the tools will automatically fall back to `sample.config.json`.

The structure for the config is as follows:

```
{
    "projection_path": "projections.csv", // This is where projections are loaded from -- the required columns are "name", "pos", "team", "salary", "projections_proj", "projections_projown", and "fantasyyear_consistency". "Ceiling" is an optional column, if not provided then it is calculated as projections_proj + fantasyyear_consistency. "Field Fpts" is also an optional column, if provided the field generation algorithm will consider this projection when building lineups instead of projections_proj. If you are optimizing or simulating for Showdown, you may also include a "cptown%" column. If it is not provided, it is calculated as half of the normal ownership.
    "player_path": "player_ids.csv", // This is where player ids are loaded from -- for DraftKings the required columns are "start_date", "draftableid", "displayname", "position", "firstname", "lastname", and "shortname".

## Output

Data is stored in the `output/` directory. Note that subsequent runs of the tool will overwrite previous output files, so either move them or rename them if you wish to preseve them. From there, you may upload these `.csv` files into Excel, and "pretty them up" - this can be seen below

### `opto` Process

![Example output](readme_images/opto_output.png)

### `sim` Process

![Example output](readme_images/sim_output.png)

### Simulation Methodology

We assume player fantasy point distributions are [multivariate gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) and create [monte carlo simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) using the provided fantasy point projections, standard deviations and player correlations. For the lineup generation process, we take the provided `tournament_lineups.csv` file (if `file` is provided as an argument in the terminal) and then sample from the provided ownership projections to fill the rest of the contest, using the field size provided in the `contest_structure.csv` file. The `max_pct_off_optimal` configuration allows the user to be specific about which generated lineups are kept and which are thrown out, based on the lineup's total projected fantasy points. Once the lineups are generated and the simulated fantasy point distributions are created, we determine the rank of each lineup for each sim and then allocate prize money based on the values provided in the `contest_structure.csv` file.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

Currently this repository only works with DraftKings MLB tournaments. FanDuel simulations will be provided at a later date.

We both come from web3/software backgrounds and we believe in the power of open source tools and collaboration. This version of our simulation modules will **always** be provided for free for all sports that we offer on GitHub.
